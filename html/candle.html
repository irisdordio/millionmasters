        <div class="catalogue-description">
            A hand-picked selection of objects with prices ranging from 1 up to 999,999 in Social Value currency.
            Our catalogue will surely delight you with the variety of products MM has to offer–from mundane
            everyday tools to by-products of credence. MM believes and assures you that the benefits of
            participating in the auction will be more than relevant to your Social Worth–with each acquired object, your
            existence will be much more unique than the one next to you.
            Respective, items own remarkable attributes and values that are chiefly unique to them. Not only this but,
            the more cryptic an object, the more Elitist it is. By instigating visible value, invisible worth, and
            hidden power on, goods it is more than possible to bring your fetishes onto reality. We love power. This
            catalogue is based on the Tarot’s Major Arcana, as it goes on to appropriate its values, systems and
            attributes. The fetishism of such an object gives exclusivity to the collection, as it analogies the
            representation of the re-symbolization of an individual moving through power systems.

                        A candle is an ignitable item that provides light, and in some instances, it may also supply
                        a fragrance. In the mid-19th century, candles became an industrialized mass market, allowing
                        its ongoing production. And so, it became an affordable commodity for the masses.

                        anoint a green candle with prosperity or money draw oil. Then I sprinkle a shredded dollar bill
                        on it, Then I sprinkle finely shredded printer’s gold on it. Next, I prepare my alter and light
                        the candle. If it burns slowly, it means that whatever financial thing I asked the gods will
                        slowly come to pass, if it all. If it burns quickly, it means I will have little resistance to
                        my financial request, and it will come to pass soon."
