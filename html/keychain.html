        <div class="catalogue-description">
            A hand-picked selection of objects with prices ranging from 1 up to 999,999 in Social Value currency.
            Our catalogue will surely delight you with the variety of products MM has to offer–from mundane
            everyday tools to by-products of credence. MM believes and assures you that the benefits of
            participating in the auction will be more than relevant to your Social Worth–with each acquired object, your
            existence will be much more unique than the one next to you.
            Respective, items own remarkable attributes and values that are chiefly unique to them. Not only this but,
            the more cryptic an object, the more Elitist it is. By instigating visible value, invisible worth, and
            hidden power on, goods it is more than possible to bring your fetishes onto reality. We love power. This
            catalogue is based on the Tarot’s Major Arcana, as it goes on to appropriate its values, systems and
            attributes. The fetishism of such an object gives exclusivity to the collection, as it analogies the
            representation of the re-symbolization of an individual moving through power systems.

                        A small ring where keys can be attached and commonly used by employees where their job requests
                        a usage of a key. The ring guarantees the safety of the attached keys and reduces accidental
                        loss of them. Keychains may also be collectables, the most popular types being monuments,
                        advertisements, souvenirs, quotes, fictional characters, and nostalgia-inducing items.

                        do not hold much value, unlike other collections, by combining
                        specific objects, the value may increase. Here is a list of items
                        most used: Credit cards, rabbit’s foot, flashlights, magnets,
                        bottle openers, ornaments, photos, USB flash drives.
