# MILLION MASTERS COLLECTION
MILLION MASTERS a hand-picked selection of objects with prices ranging from 1 up to 999,999 in Social Value currency. Our catalogue will surely delight you with the variety of products MM has to offer – from mundane everyday tools to by-products of credence. MM believes and assures you that the benefits of participating in the auction will be more than relevant to your Social Worth – with each acquired object, your existence will be much more unique than the one next to you. Respective, items own remarkable attributes and values that are chiefly unique to them. Not only this but, the more cryptic an object, the more Elitist it is. By instigating visible value, invisible worth, and hidden power on, goods it is more than possible to bring your fetishes onto reality. 
We love power. This catalogue is based on the Tarot’s Major Arana, as it goes on to appropriate its values, systems and attributes. The fetishism of such an object gives exclusivity to the collection, as it analogies the representation of the re-symbolization of an individual moving through power systems.
