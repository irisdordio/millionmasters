                A hand-picked selection of objects withprices ranging from 1 up to 999,999 in Social Value currency.
                Ourcatalogue will surely delight you with the variety of products MM has to offer – from mundane
                everyday tools to by-products of credence. MM believes and assures you that the benefits of
                participating in the
                auction will be more than relevant to your Social Worth – with each acquired object, your existence will
                be much more
                unique than the one next to you. Respective, items own remarkable attributes and values that are chiefly
                unique
                to them. Not only this but, the more cryptic an object, the more Elitist it is. By instigating visible
                value, invisible worth, and hidden power on, goods it is more than possible to bring your fetishes onto
                reality. We love power. This catalogue is based on the Tarot’s Major Arana, as it goes on to appropriate
                its values,
                systems and attributes. The fetishism of such an object gives exclusivity to the collection, as it
                analogies the
                representation of the re-symbolization of an individual moving through power systems.

                    <div class="object-description">A candle is an ignitable item that provides
                        light, and in some instances, it may also supply
                        a fragrance. In the mid-19th century, candles became an industrialized mass market, allowing
                        its ongoing production. And so, it became
                        an affordable commodity for the masses.</div>

                        anoint a green candle with prosperity or money
                        draw oil. Then I sprinkle a shredded dollar bill on it, Then I sprinkle finely shredded
                        printer’s gold on it. Next, I
                        prepare my alter and light the candle. If it burns slowly, it means that whatever financial
                        thing I asked the gods will
                        slowly come to pass, if it all. If it burns quickly, it means I will have little resistance to
                        my financial request, and
                        it will come to pass soon."
