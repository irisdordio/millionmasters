                A hand-picked selection of objects withprices ranging from 1 up to 999,999 in Social Value currency.
                Ourcatalogue will surely delight you with the variety of products MM has to offer – from mundane
                everyday tools to by-products of credence. MM believes and assures you that the benefits of
                participating in the
                auction will be more than relevant to your Social Worth – with each acquired object, your existence will
                be much more
                unique than the one next to you. Respective, items own remarkable attributes and values that are chiefly
                unique
                to them. Not only this but, the more cryptic an object, the more Elitist it is. By instigating visible
                value, invisible worth, and hidden power on, goods it is more than possible to bring your fetishes onto
                reality. We love power. This catalogue is based on the Tarot’s Major Arana, as it goes on to appropriate
                its values,
                systems and attributes. The fetishism of such an object gives exclusivity to the collection, as it
                analogies the
                representation of the re-symbolization of an individual moving through power systems.

                        and Solitaire; cardistry; or magic tricks—playing cards have been in use for many centuries.
                        Playing cards may even have been invented,
                        in the 9th century AD, during the Tang dynasty, an imperial dynasty of China that ruled from 618
                        to 907. Through
                        generations, corporations have commonly adapted playing cards to their needs. For example, the
                        gambling industry has
                        designed playing cards specifically for their casinos.</div>

                        life and , that being said the, thirteen cards
                        in each suit portray the thirteen lunar months. However, since each corporation designs a card
                        at their will, more
                        attributes are conjured onto the object. This card, in specific, owns nothing
                        more than the value needed for a status quo.
