                A hand-picked selection of objects withprices ranging from 1 up to 999,999 in Social Value currency.
                Ourcatalogue will surely delight you with the variety of products MM has to offer – from mundane
                everyday tools to by-products of credence. MM believes and assures you that the benefits of
                participating in the
                auction will be more than relevant to your Social Worth – with each acquired object, your existence will
                be much more
                unique than the one next to you. Respective, items own remarkable attributes and values that are chiefly
                unique
                to them. Not only this but, the more cryptic an object, the more Elitist it is. By instigating visible
                value, invisible worth, and hidden power on, goods it is more than possible to bring your fetishes onto
                reality. We love power. This catalogue is based on the Tarot’s Major Arana, as it goes on to appropriate
                its values,
                systems and attributes. The fetishism of such an object gives exclusivity to the collection, as it
                analogies the
                representation of the re-symbolization of an individual moving through power systems.

                        employees where their job requests a a usage of a key. The
                        ring guarantees the safety of the attached keys and reduces accidental loss of them. Keychains
                        may also be collectables,

                        do not hold much value, unlike other collections, by combining
                        specific objects, the value may increase. Here is a list of items
                        most used: Credit cards, rabbit’s foot,h flashlights, magnets,
                        bottle openers, ornaments, photos, USB flash drives.
